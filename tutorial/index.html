		<h2>The Goal</h2>

		<p>
		Some applications need to distribute work to many machines because one single box
		obviously has limited resources. This tutorial will explain how to implement
		distributed workers with Akka cluster features.
		</p>

		<p><img src="tutorial/img1.png" border="0" /></p>

		<p>
		The solution should support:
		</p>
		<ul>
		<li>elastic addition/removal of front end nodes that receives work from clients</li>
		<li>elastic addition/removal of worker actors and worker nodes</li>
        <li>thousands of workers</li>
		<li>jobs should not be lost, and if a worker fails, the job should be retried</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
		The design is based on Derek Wyatt's blog post
		<a href="http://letitcrash.com/post/29044669086/balancing-workload-across-nodes-with-akka-2"
		target="_blank">Balancing Workload Across Nodes with Akka 2</a>. This article describes
		the advantages of letting the workers pull work from the master instead of pushing work to
		the workers.
        </p>

		<h2>Explore the Code - Master</h2>

		<p>
		The heart of the solution is the Master actor that manages outstanding work
		and notifies registered workers when new work is available.
		</p>

		<p>
		The Master actor is a singleton within the nodes with role "backend" in the cluster.
		This means that there will be one active master actor in the cluster. It runs on the
		oldest node.
		</p>

		<p>
		You can see how the master singleton is started in the method <code>startBackend</code>
		in <a href="#code/src/main/scala/worker/Main.scala" class="shortcut">Main.scala</a>
		</p>

		<p><img src="tutorial/img2.png" border="0" /></p>

		<p>
		In case of failure of the master node another master actor is automatically started on
		a standby node. The master on the standby node takes over the responsibility for
		outstanding work. Work in progress can continue and will be reported to the new master.
		The state of the master can be re-created on the standby node using event sourcing.
		An alternative to event sourcing and the singleton master would be to keep track of all
		jobs in a central database, but that is more complicated and not as scalable. In the end
		of the tutorial we will describe how multiple masters can be supported with a small adjustment.
		</p>

		<p>
		The master actor is made available for both front end and workers by registering itself
		in the <a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.0-RC1/contrib/distributed-pub-sub.html"
		target="_blank">DistributedPubSubMediator</a>.
		</p>

		<p><img src="tutorial/img3.png" border="0" /></p>

		<p><img src="tutorial/img4.png" border="0" /></p>

		<p>
		Later we will explore the implementation of the <a href="#code/src/main/scala/worker/Master.scala" class="shortcut">Master</a>
		actor in depth, but first we will take a look at the front end and worker that interacts with the master.
		</p>

	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Explore the Code - Front End</h2>

		<p>
		A typical front end provides a RESTful API that is used by the clients to submit (POST) jobs.
		When the service has accepted the job it returns Created/201 response code to the client.
		If it can't accept the job it returns a failure response code and the client has to retry or
		discard the job.
		</p>

		<p>
		In this example the front end is emulated, for simplicity, by an ordinary actor, see
		<a href="#code/src/main/scala/worker/Frontend.scala" class="shortcut">Frontend.scala</a>
		and client requests are simulated by the
		<a href="#code/src/main/scala/worker/WorkProducer.scala" class="shortcut">WorkProducer.scala</a>.
		As you can see the <code>Frontend</code> actor sends the work to the active master via the
		<code>DistributedPubSubMediator</code>. It doesn't care about the exact location of the
		master. Somewhere in the cluster there should be one master actor running.
		The message is sent with <code>ask/?</code> to be able to reply to the client (<code>WorkProducer</code>)
		when the job has been accepted or denied by the master.
		</p>

		<p><img src="tutorial/img5.png" border="0" /></p>

		<p>
		You can see how a Fronteend and WorkProducer actor is started in the method <code>startFrontend</code>
		in <a href="#code/src/main/scala/worker/Main.scala" class="shortcut">Main.scala</a>
		</p>

	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>Explore the Code - Worker</h2>

		<p>
		We should support many worker nodes and we assume that they can be unstable. Therefore we
		don't let the worker nodes be members of the cluster, instead they communicate with the cluster
		through the <a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.0-RC1/contrib/cluster-client.html"
		target="_blank">Cluster Client</a>. The worker doesn't have to know exactly where the master
		is located.
		</p>

		<p><img src="tutorial/img6.png" border="0" /></p>

		<p>
		You can see how a worker is started in the method <code>startWorker</code>
		in <a href="#code/src/main/scala/worker/Main.scala" class="shortcut">Main.scala</a>
		</p>

		<p>
		Open <a href="#code/src/main/scala/worker/Worker.scala" class="shortcut">Worker.scala</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
		The worker register itself periodically to the master, see the <code>registerTask</code>.
		This has the nice characteristics that master and worker can be started in any order, and
		in case of master fail over the worker re-register itself to the new master.
		</p>

		<p><img src="tutorial/img7.png" border="0" /></p>

		<p>
		The Frontend actor sends the work to the master actor.
		</p>

		<p><img src="tutorial/img8.png" border="0" /></p>

		<p>
		When the worker receives work from the master it delegates the actual processing to
		a child actor, <a href="#code/src/main/scala/worker/WorkExecutor.scala" class="shortcut">WorkExecutor</a>,
		to keep the worker responsive while executing the work.
		</p>

		<p><img src="tutorial/img9.png" border="0" /></p>

	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Explore the Code - Master Revisited</h2>

		<p>
		Now when we know more about the Worker and Frontend that interacts with the Master it
		is time to take a closer look at
		<a href="#code/src/main/scala/worker/Master.scala" class="shortcut">Master.scala</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
		Workers register itself to the master with <code>RegisterWorker</code>. Each worker
		has an unique identifier and the master keeps track of the workers, including current
		<code>ActorRef</code> (sender of <code>RegisterWorker</code> message) that can be used
		for sending notifications to the worker. This <code>ActorRef</code> is not a direct
		link to the worker actor, but messages sent to it will be delivered to the worker.
		When using the cluster client messages are are tunneled via the receptionist on some
		node in the cluster to avoid inbound connections from other cluster nodes to the client.
		</p>

		<p>
		When the master receives <code>Work</code> from front end it adds the work item to
		the queue of pending work and notifies idle workers with <code>WorkIsReady</code> message.
		</p>

		<p>
		To be able to restore same state in case of fail over to a standby master actor the
		changes (domain events) are stored in an append only transaction log and can be replayed
		when standby actor is started. This event sourcing is not implemented in the example yet.
		The <a href="https://github.com/eligosource/eventsourced" target="_blank">Eventsourced</a> library
		can be used for that. When the domain event has been saved successfully the master replies
		with an acknowledgement message (<code>Ack</code>) to the front end.
		The master also keeps track of accepted work identifiers to be able to discard duplicates
		sent from the front end.
		</p>

		<p><img src="tutorial/img8.png" border="0" /></p>

		<p>
		When a worker receives <code>WorkIsReady</code> it sends back <code>WorkerRequestsWork</code>
		to the master, which hands out the work, if any, to the worker. The master keeps track of that
		the worker is busy and expect a result within a deadline. For long running jobs the worker
		could send progress messages, but that is not implemented in the example.
		</p>

		<p><img src="tutorial/img9.png" border="0" /></p>

		<p>
		When the worker sends <code>WorkIsDone</code> the master updates its state of the worker
		and sends acknowledgement back to the worker. This message must also be idempotent as the worker will
		re-send if it doesn't receive the acknowledgement.
		</p>

		<h2>Summary</h2>

		<p>
		The <a href="#code/src/main/scala/worker/Master.scala" class="shortcut">Master</a> actor
		is a <a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.0-RC1/contrib/cluster-singleton.html#cluster-singleton"
		target="_blank">Cluster Singleton</a> and register itself in 
		<a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.0-RC1/contrib/distributed-pub-sub.html"
		target="_blank">DistributedPubSubMediator</a>.
		<p>

		<p>
		The <a href="#code/src/main/scala/worker/Frontend.scala" class="shortcut">Frontend</a> actor send work
		to the master via the mediator.
		</p>

		<p>
		The <a href="#code/src/main/scala/worker/Worker.scala" class="shortcut">Worker</a> communicate with the
		cluster and its master with the <a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.0-RC1/contrib/cluster-client.html"
		target="_blank">Cluster Client</a>.
		</p>

		<h2>Run the Application</h2>

		<p>
			Open the <a href="#run" class="shortcut">Run</a> tab and select <code>worker.Main</code> followed
			by Restart. On the left-hand side we can see the console output, which is logging output
			from nodes joining the cluster, the simulated work and results.
		</p>

		<p>

	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Many Masters</h2>

		<p>
		If the singleton master becomes a bottleneck we can start several master actors and
		shard the jobs among them. For each shard of master/standby nodes we use a separate
		cluster role name, e.g. "backend-shard1", "backend-shard2".
		</p>

		<p>
		In <a href="#code/src/main/scala/worker/MainManyMasters.scala" class="shortcut">MainManyMasters.scala</a>
		you can see startup of multiple masters in action. Everything else remains the same.
		Note that <code>Frontend</code> sends work to the master with <code>DistributedPubSubMediator.Send</code>,
		which means that one work item is sent to only one master.
